# webscrapping

This repository was created to compile various webscrapping studies I have done during time using python.

Each study will be stored in a folder within this repository. If any webscrapping study evolve to a full project, a dedicated repository will be created to store it.

Projects in this folder:

  - search for some given key word (produto)
  - store the products related to the key word in a dataframe
  - save the resulting DataFrame into a csv flie


## get_lat_long
